    "\n",
    "We use 2 python packages - `nltk` & `numpy`. From `nltk` we use the wordnet, punkt & averaged_perceptron_tagger libraries. The last one is the parts of speech (pos) tagger. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "# nltk.download('wordnet')\n",
    "# nltk.download('punkt')\n",
    "# nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n",

    "There are 2 parts to this stage.\n",
    "### Initializing word vectors\n",
    "The paper uses [Skipgram](https://becominghuman.ai/how-does-word2vecs-skip-gram-work-f92e0525def4) to train the word vectors from large amounts of text data. Since we use [glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and [dependency-based](https://levyomer.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/dependency-based-word-embeddings/) word embeddings for word vector representation, we skip the training. Below is a method to load the word vectors.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_glove_vectors(glove_file):\n",
    "    f = open(glove_file, 'r')\n",
    "    vectors = {}\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        split_line = line.split()\n",
    "        word = split_line[0]\n",
    "        embedding = np.array([float(val) for val in split_line[1:]])\n",
    "        vectors[word] = embedding\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "    return vectors\n",
    "```\n",
    "This returns a dictionary of words and their corresponding vector embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Our glove data can be found [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/))\n",
    "### Initializing sense vectors\n",
    "As outlined in Initializing sense vectors in Section 2.2 of the paper, we only consider words that are either *noun*, *verb*, *adjective* or *adverb* as candidates for disambiguation. We filter out the correct parts of speech with the following method,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_valid_pos_tag(tag):\n",
    "    if tag.startswith('J') or tag.startswith('V') or tag.startswith('N') or tag.startswith('R'):\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could not compile an exhaustive list of tags for the 4 parts of speech (pos) we are interested in. There are many different forms of tags for verb, noun, adjective and adverb as we've explored in the pos-tagger library. For this reason, we went on to choose the pos tags that start with one of the 4 letters - J, V, N and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each candidate word has one or more *sense* and each sense has one or more *gloss* in wordnet. For each sense, the task is to find its cosine similarities to each of the words in its gloss; then only take those words that clear a similarity threshold.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cosine_sim_threshold = 0.05 # can be experimented with values ranging between 0-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "We find the normalized dot product between a sense vector and a word vector in its gloss to find their cosine similarity.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cos_sim = dot(gloss_word_vec, candidate_vec) / (norm(gloss_word_vec) * norm(candidate_vec))\n",
    "if cos_sim > cosine_sim_threshold:\n",
    "    word_vectors.append(gloss_word_vec)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the average of the vectors for these words is used as the initialization value of the sense vector.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sense_vector = average(word_vectors)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The method below returns all sense vectors for a candidate word -\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_word_sense_vectors(candidate):\n",
    "    vectors = {}\n",

    "    for ss in wn.synsets(candidate):\n",

    "        pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)\n",
    "        word_vectors = []\n",
    "        for gloss_pos, tag in pos_tags:\n",
    "            if get_valid_pos_tag(tag):\n",
    "                try:\n",
    "                    gloss_word_vec = glove[gloss_pos]\n",
    "                except Exception:\n",
    "                    continue\n",

    "        vectors[ss] = sense_vector\n",
    "    return vectors\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Stage 2: Performing Word Sense Disambiguation\n",
    "In order to disambiguate all of the content words in a sentence, the authors of the paper designed 2 algorithms namely - L2R (left to right) & S2C (simple to complex). They describe their algorithms as followed -\n",
    "> The main difference between L2R and S2C is the order of words when performing word sense disambiguation. When given a sentence, the L2R algorithm disambiguates the words from left to right (the natural order of a sentence), whereas the S2C algorithm disambiguates the words with fewer senses first. The main idea of S2C algorithm is that the words with fewer senses are easier to disambiguate, and the disambiguation result can be helpful to sambiguate the words with more senses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our implementation we chose S2C. There are 3 steps to this.\n",
    "### Context vector initialization\n",
    "Similar to the initialization of sense vectors, the average of all of the content words’ vectors in a sentence as the initialization vector of context.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context_vec = average(list(pos_vectors.values()), 0) # 0 denotes the axis of vector\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `pos_vectors` contains the content word vectors from input sentence.\n",
    "### Ranking words\n",
    "According to the algorithm, we rank the content words based on the ascending order of their number of senses.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sorted_sense_vectors_collection = sorted(sorted_sense_vectors_collection.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `sorted_sense_vectors_collection` contains a dictionary of content words and a list containing their corresponding sense vectors - before sorting. Then we pass it to the `sorted()` numpy method.\n",
    "### Word sense disambiguation\n",
    "For each content word in the `sorted_sense_vectors_collection`, we compute the cosine similarities between its sense vectors and the context vector. We choose the sense that yields the maximum cosine similarity as its disambiguation result and then use the sense vector to replace the word vector in `pos_vectors`. Then we repeat the 2nd step to recalculate our context vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire step is repeated until all content words are disambiguated.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def disambiguate_word_sense(word, context_vector):\n",
    "    vectors = sense_vectors_collection[word]\n",
    "    if len(vectors) == 0:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    cos_sims = {}\n",
    "    for sense, sense_vector in vectors.items():\n",
    "        cos_sim = dot(context_vector, sense_vector) / (norm(context_vector) * norm(sense_vector))\n",
    "        cos_sims[sense] = cos_sim\n",
    "    sorted_list = sorted(cos_sims.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "    if len(sorted_list) == 0:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    nearest_sense = sorted_list.pop()[0]\n",
    "    return nearest_sense\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Pitfall - Undefined score margin threshold\n",
    "In step 3 of Word sense disambiguation, we find the sense vector that has the maximum cosine similarity with the context vector, and use that sense to replace the original word. However, as the paper describes\n",
    ">We choose the sense that yields the maximum cosine similarity as its disambiguation result. If the score margin between the maximum and the second maximum is larger than the threshold ε, we are confident with the isambiguation result of wi and then use the sense vector to replace the word vector in the context vector. Thus, we obtain a\n",
    "more accurate context vector for other words that are still yet to be disambiguated.\n",
    "\n",
    "we did not use any score margin threshold (`ε`). This is because the authors did not mention about a specific value for threshold in relevant examples. And although in **Section 3.5 Parameter Influence** they disclosed that their model achieved best performance when this threshold is 0.1, we could not verify that with our dataset."
